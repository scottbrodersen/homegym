# Home Gym

A workout log that you can access over wifi from your home gym. It includes an HTTP server with an embedded web app and an embedded database:

- backend is implemented in [Go](https://go.dev/)
- database is [BadgerDB](https://dgraph.io/docs/badger/)
- front end is implemented in [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) using [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) components
- [documentation](https://scottbrodersen.github.io/homegym/) is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

Home Gym requires authentication for access and supports multiple users. Users are authorized to access only their own data.
