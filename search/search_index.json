To see the charts, on the menu bar click Analyze. Analyze Exercise Volume The Exercise Volume chart shows the total work that you've performed for one or more exercises each day. Load and Volume are plotted against time. The type of volume that is defined for an exercise determines how it is aggregated: Counts: total number of reps Times: total number of hours Distances: total number of kilometers Load is the intensity multiplied by the volume. The intensity values used in these calculations are as follows: Weight: the weight Bodyweight: one RPE: the RPE number Heart rate zones: the zone number Pace: the number of seconds Comparing the load and volume values provides insight into the type of workout that was performed: A high load and a low volume indicates high intensity. A high load and a high volume indicate a lot of work at lower intensity. Filter the volume chart The default view of the Volume Chart includes the total volume for every exercise that you have performed. Use the filter to narrow your focus on a subset of exercises. You can either use one of the provided filters that define subsets based on the type of intensity or select the exercises one by one. The following filters are provided: Weight-based: All exercises based on weight Cardio: All exercises that use heart rate zones, distance, and pace Bodyweight: All bodyweight exercises RPE: All RPE-based exercises To filter the exercises: Above the Exercise Volume chart, click Exercise Filters to reveal the filters. By default, all exercises are in the filter as can be seen by the tags that appear. Select a filter group. Only the exercises in the group are filtered.

For example, a runner would create an activity called Running. Then, they would add different types of workout segments and exercises that they perform such as Run, Squats, and so on. Create an activity Name the activity that you participate in so that you can associate it with your programs and your training log. You can create multiple activities for when you train for different sports at different times of the year. The training log and performance metrics for each activity are aggregated separately so that you can analyze your progress for one sport in isolation from the other. For example, if you train for 10k runs in the summer and 10k cross-country skiing in the winter, you could create a Running activity and a Skiing activity. However, a triathlete who swims, runs, and cycles during the same period would create only one activity named Triathlon. In the menu bar, click Activity > Activities. Click the + icon next to Activities. Enter the activity name and then click Save. Create an exercise Create an exercise that you perform during a workout so that you can track the volume of work that you perform with it. Examples of strength training exercises are Squat or Deadlift. Running exercises would be characterized by workout segments that are performed at different intensities such as Sprint, Threshold Run, or Easy Run. In addition to the exercise name, you specify how to express the intensity and volume. Several types of intensities and volumes are provided that you use to configure your exercises. Strength training exercises typically use weight for intensity and count (i.e. sets and reps) for volume. For cardio, you might use RPE, heart rate, or pace as intensity and time or distance as the volume. When an exercise that is tracked by counting reps is highly skills-based, it can be useful to record failed attempts. For example, you might want to record failed snatches to monitor your success rate. Failed attempts do not contribute to overall volume calculations. Repeat the following steps for each exercise that you want to add. You don't have to add all of them at once; you can add exercises at any time. In the menu bar, click Activity > Exercises. Click the + icon next to Exercises. Enter a name, intensity type, and volume type. For count volumes, select Track Failed Reps when monitoring failed attempts is important to you. Make a composite exercise An exercise can be a composite of two or more exercises. Configure an exercise as a composite so that the volume performed for the composite is also counted for the exercises of which it is comprised. For example, a clean can be thought of as being comprised of a pull and a front squat. You create the Clean exercise and configure it to be a composite of the Pull and the Front Squat (or simply Squat, however you want to track your volume). For each exercise that comprises the composite, you indicate the number of reps that are performed. Some weightlifting programs prescribe exercises as literal combinations, such as Clean + 2 Front squats. By indicating 2 reps for the front squat, when you log 1 rep of the Clean + 2 Front squat exercise, 2 reps for the Front Squat exercise is aggregated and one rep for the Clean exercise is aggregated. On the menu bar, click Activity > Exercises. Select the exercise that you want to configure as a composite. Click the pencil icon next the Properties. Select Composite Exercise and then click the arrow icon that appears next to it. Select the exercises of which the exercise you are configuring is a composite. Next to each exercise, enter the number of reps that are performed. Click Done. Click the save icon.

Click the arrow icon next to the intensity to record the associated volume. In the dialog that opens, enter the volume for the first set: For a count, enter the reps that you performed. If tracking failed reps, enter the result of each rep (fail or success). Click the + icon to add another set, and enter the volume. When all your sets and reps are added, click Done to close the dialog. To add volume at another intensity, click the + icon and repeat the previous steps. To enter heart-rate zone intensities: For each heart rate zone, enter the time that you spent in that zone. To enter rate of perceived exertion (RPE) based volume: Enter the RPE level. Enter the time or distance, depending on how volume is measured. To enter subsequent time or distance at another RPE, click the + icon and repeat the previous steps. To enter volume based on pace intensities: Enter the pace. Enter the time or distance, depending on how volume is measured. To enter a subsequent time or distance at another pace, click the + icon and repeat the previous steps. To complete the log entry: Add more exercises and configure them as needed. (Optional) Specify an Overall Performance value if you want to indicate how you felt during the workout. (Optional) Add any notes that you want to mention for later reference. Click Save. Review the log Each workout that you record appears in the workout log on the home page. Each row represents a workout and shows an overview of what was performed. Click a row to reveal the details of the workout. If you need to edit a workout, click the pencil icon. Track daily health markers Log aspects of your daily health to objectively measure factors that might affect your training. For example, a downward trend in your hours of sleep might coincide with a decrease in performance. The following once-daily measurements can be logged: Hours of sleep Body weight Mood Stress level Energy level Mood, stress, and energy are measured on a scale of 0-5. Additionally, a few items can be logged multiple times in one day: Food intake Blood pressure Blood glucose All daily stats are optional. Track only the ones that you are interested in. On the menu bar, click the hamburger menu. Click the item that you want to track. Change the date and/or time if necessary. Note that time only matters for blood pressure, blood glucose, and food measurements. The sleep metric supports decimal numbers. Weight must be a whole number, and mood, stress, and energy are a scale of 0-5. Blood glucose supports decimal numbers, and is measured in mmol/L. If you measure values in mg/dL just ignore the mmol/L units label. For blood pressure, enter the systolic and diastolic values. For food, you can track nutrition using a general description or measurements for protein, carbs, fat, and fiber, depending on how closely you monitor your intake.","title":"Log"},{"location":"track/#log-your-performance","text":"Log your workouts so that you can review them later. You can also enter daily health markers to track trends or relate them to exercise performance. Analytics are provided for both exercise volume and daily health markers so that you can spot trends.","title":"Log your performance"},{"location":"track/#log-a-workout","text":"Log the work that you perform for each exercise in the workout. You can either log it as you work out or later if that is more convenient. These steps for adding a workout are meant to be used to log ad-hoc workouts, or workouts that were not planned as part of a program. Log workouts in this way when you do not intend to follow a program or if you have not yet added a program. If you start a program after you log the ad-hoc workout, you can later link the ad-hoc workout to a planned workout. The link causes the planned workout to be marked as having been completed. If you are executing a planned workout, you should start the workout from the program so that it is easier to enter the workout information and the planned workout is automatically marked as complete.","title":"Log a workout"},{"location":"track/#add-an-exercise","text":"At the bottom of the Home page, click Add Event.
