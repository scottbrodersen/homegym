# Welcome to HomeGym

HomeGym is a web app that you use to manage many aspects of your training regime for any activity that you perform. Most importantly, you can conveniently record your workout from your home gym while you're working out. Later you can analyze your progress using the workout log and aggregated performance metrics. You access the HomeGym web page over wifi using a web browser to:

- Prepare your activities
- Log your performances
- Plan workouts using programs
- Execute your programs
- Analyze the data

HomeGym consists of a server and a database that you run on a computer in your local network. It supports multiple users who authenticate using a username and password. Each user's data is stored separately in the database to be kept private.

To begin, [build and install the server](install.md).
