## Analyze Your Performance

Once you have logged workouts and daily health markers, the data is plotted in three charts so that you can spot trends. To see the charts, on the menu bar click Analyze.

## Analyze Exercise Volume

The Exercise Volume chart shows the total work that you've performed for one or more exercises each day. Load and Volume are plotted against time.

The type of volume that is defined for an exercise determines how it is aggregated:

- Counts: total number of reps
- Times: total number of hours
- Distances: total number of kilometers

Load is the intensity multiplied by the volume. The intensity values used in these calculations are as follows:

- Weight: the weight
- Bodyweight: one
- RPE: the RPE number
- Heart rate zones: the zone number
- Pace: the number of seconds

Comparing the load and volume values provides insight into the type of workout that was performed:

- A high load and a low volume indicates high intensity.
- A high load and a high volume indicate a lot of work at lower intensity.

### Filter the volume chart

The default view of the Volume Chart includes the total volume for every exercise that you have performed. Use the filter to narrow your focus on a subset of exercises.

You can either use one of the provided filters that define subsets based on the type of intensity or select the exercises one by one. The following filters are provided:

- Weight-based: All exercises based on weight
- Cardio: All exercises that use heart rate zones, distance, and pace
- Bodyweight: All bodyweight exercises
- RPE: All RPE-based exercises

##### To filter the exercises:

1. Above the Exercise Volume chart, click Exercise Filters to reveal the filters.
   <br />By default, all exercises are in the filter as can be seen by the tags that appear.
