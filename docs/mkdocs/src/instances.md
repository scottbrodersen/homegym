# Execute a Training Program

When you are ready to execute a training program you specify the date of the first day of the program. Doing so creates an instance of the program that is saved and managed separately from the program:

- You can make changes to the program instance without altering the program.
- You can make changes to the program without altering the instances that were generated from it.

Once you start a program, a dashboard appears on the home page that provides details of the day's workout.

You can schedule multiple consecutive program instances, for example when you repeatedly perform a weekly routine. However, if program instances overlap only the one that starts first appears in the dashboard.

All the program instances that you have created appear in a list so that you can view or edit them as needed.

1. Click Program on the menu bar.
2. Select the activity and then click the Programs drop down.

## Explore a program instance

Open a program instance to review the properties.

1. On the Program page, select the program instance that you want to view.
   <br />The calendar that appears shows a blue tag on each day that a workout occurs in the program instance.
   <br/>Below the calendar is the name of the base program as well as the titles and descriptions of the block and microcycle that contain the selected day.
   <br/>Below that is a list of workouts in the microcycle.

2. Click a day on the calendar that has a workout on it.
   <br />In the list of workouts, the one corresponding with the one you clicked is highlighted.

## Start a workout

Start a workout when you are ready to enter the data for it.

You can use this method to start a workout only on the day that the workout occurs. If you performed the workout on a previous day, you need to [log the workout](track.md#log-a-workout) and then link it to the previously scheduled workout.

1. On the program dashboard (Home page), click the play icon next to today's program. <img src="../img/icon_play_round.png" width="35"/>
   <br/><img src="../img/pgminst_dash.png" width="450"/>
   <br/> The workout opens in edit mode, initialized with the planned exercises.
   <br/><img src="../img/pgminst_init.png" width="700"/>
2. Change the time if you have already completed the workout rather than logging it as you work out.
3. Add the details of your performance for each exercise in the same way that is described in [Log a workout](track.md#log-a-workout).
4. Click Save
   <br/>The program dash now shows that today's workout has been completed.
   <br/><img src="../img/pgminst_dash_done.png" width="350"/>

## Link to an existing workout

Link a logged workout that you [added ad-hoc](track.md#log-a-workout) to a workout in your program instance. After linking, the scheduled workout will be marked as complete.

1. On the Program page, select the program instance to which you are linking the logged workout.
2. Locate the workout that you are linking to and click the hamburger menu.
   <br/><img src="../img/pgminst_workout_link.png" width="300"/>
3. Click Link.
   <br/> A dialog appears that shows a list of workouts that you performed on the day of the scheduled workout.
   <br/><img src="../img/pgminst_workout_logged.png" width="300"/>
4. Select the workout to link and then click OK.
   <br/> The status for the workout in the program changes to complete.
   <br/><img src="../img/pgminst_workout_status_done.png" width="300"/>
   <br />The program dashboard also shows that the workout was completed.
   <br/><img src="../img/pgminst_dash_linked_done.png" width="550"/>

## Edit a workout {: #edit }

You can make changes to the details of a logged workout at any time.

1. On the home page, expand the workout in the log and click the pencil icon.
   <br/><img src="../img/log_workout_edit.png" width="500"/></li>
